# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This is the README file for the final project in the Coursera Course: Getting and Cleaning Data.

***

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

*** 

Within this repo, it consists of 4 files:

* README.md: Explains how all the files within this repo work and how they are connected.

* CodeBook.md: Provides background and other relevant information on the data collected and used; explanation of the variables and its units; operations performed according to the tasks instructed; license.

* run_analysis.R: 
    + 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    + 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each                measurement.
    + 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    + 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    + 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the          average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
* output.txt: The second independent tidy data set that contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, as instructed in Step 5 of the tasks.
